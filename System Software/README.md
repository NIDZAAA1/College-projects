Abstract Computer System Tools

Project Overview

This repository contains tools for simulating and compiling programs for an abstract computer system. The tools include:

Assembler: Translates assembly code into machine code.
Linker: Resolves symbols and combines object files into a final executable format.
Emulator: Executes the machine code on an abstract processor simulation.

These components are designed to work together to emulate the full lifecycle of a program, from source code to execution on a simulated architecture.

Directory Structure

src/: Contains source code for the assembler, linker, and emulator.

inc/: Header files for the project.

misc/: Lexer and parser.

tests/: Sample assembly files and test cases.
