Abstract Computer System Emulator
Overview
This project implements three key components of an abstract computer system:

Assembler - A single-pass assembler for converting assembly code into machine code.
Linker - A linker independent of the target architecture that resolves symbols and relocates sections.
Emulator - An emulator that simulates the execution of programs on an abstract processor.

Project Structure
src/: Source code for assembler, linker, and emulator.
inc/: Header files.
tests/: Test files demonstrating the functionality of the tools.
